# NAME
#     beautify
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#     Beautify all modified and added source files in your svn working copy.
#     Without beautification, a svn commit may be rejected. Currently, the 
#     beautification is performed by "uncrustify" using the configuration
#     file "tools/beautifier/beautify.cfg".
#
# PRECONDITION
#     Your working copy must contain everything under trunk, branches/FOO or
#     tags/BAR, i.e. you checkout was one of 
#       "svn co $REPOSITORY_ROOT/project/trunk"
#       "svn co $REPOSITORY_ROOT/project/branches/<FOO>"
#       "svn co $REPOSITORY_ROOT/project/tags/<BAR>"
#
# OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS
#     beautify does not take any options and/or arguments.
#
# USAGE
#     Call beautify from anywhere in your svn working copy.

# General idea:
# - cd to the top-level directory of your svn working copy in order to find 
#   all modified and added source files and to get access to the beautifier's
#   config file.
# - beautify these files (unless they have zero size) in place and make a
#   backup.

# cd to top-level directory, i.e. something svn controlled at a equivalent level
# to (trunk|branches/<FOO>|tags/<BAR>). Count "/"s in path therefore.
