Usage: opari2 [OPTION] ... infile [outfile]

****************** general options and parameters *******************

[--f77|--f90|--c|--c++]
  [OPTIONAL] Specifies the programming language of the input source
  file. This option is only necessary if the automatic language
  detection based on the input file suffix fails.

[--free-form]
  [OPTIONAL] Specifies that free formatting is used for Fortran source
  files. This is the default for Fortran 90/95.

[--fix-form]
  [OPTIONAL] Specifies that fixed formatting is used for Fortran source
  files. This is the default for Fortran 77.

[--nosrc]
  [OPTIONAL] If specified, OPARI2 does not generate #line constructs,
  which allow to preserve the original source file and line number
  information, in the transformation process. This option might be
  necessary if the OpenMP compiler does not understand #line
  constructs.  The default is to generate #line constructs.

[--disable=paradigm[:directive|group[:inner],...][+paradigm...]
  [OPTIONAL] Disable the instrumentation of whole paradigms, or
  specific directives or groups of directives of a paradigm.
  Furthermore it gives the possibility to suppress the insertion of
  instrumentation functions inside code regions, i.e. only the
  surrounding instrumentation is inserted. See the paradigm 
  sections below.

[--preprocessed]
  [OPTIONAL] Indicates that the source file is already
  preprocessed. It requires that necessary instrumentation interface
  headers are already included. Furthermore, it requires a marker,
  e.g.  ___POMP2_INCLUDE___ immediately after the respective include
  file.

[--version]
  [OPTIONAL] Prints version information.

[--help]
  [OPTIONAL] Prints this help text.

infile
  Input file name.

[outfile]
  [OPTIONAL] Output file name. If not specified, OPARI2 uses the name
  infile.mod.suffix if the input file is called infile.suffix.

********************** OpenMP specific options **********************

[--disable=omp[:directive|group,...]
  [OPTIONAL] Accepted directives are 'atomic', 'critical', 'master',
  'flush', 'single', 'ordered' or 'locks'. These directives form the
  group 'sync', that disables all of them. The group 'task' prevents
  the instrumentation of task directives.
  E.g., --disable=omp:master,atomic diables the instrumentation of
  master and atomic directives.

[--omp-nodecl]
  [OPTIONAL] Disables the generation of POMP2_DLISTXXXXX macros. These
  are used in the parallel directives of the instrumentation to make
  the region handles shared. By using this option the shared clause is
  used directly on the parallel directive with the respective region
  handles.

[--omp-tpd]
  [OPTIONAL] Adds the clause 'copyin(<pomp_tpd>)' to any parallel
  construct. This allows to pass data from the creating thread to its
  children. The variable is declared externally in all files, so it
  needs to be defined by the pomp library. This option is not
  supported when using the Fujitsu compiler.

[--omp-tpd-mangling=gnu|intel|sun|pgi|ibm|cray]
  [OPTIONAL] If programming languages are mixed(C and Fortran), the
  <pomp_tpd> needs to use the Fortran mangled name also in C files.
  This option specifies to use the mangling scheme of the gnu, intel,
  sun, pgi or ibm compiler. The default is to use the mangling scheme
  of the compiler used to build OPARI2.

[--omp-task=abort|warn|remove]
  Special treatment for the task directive
  abort:  Stop instrumentation with an error message when encountering
          a task directive.
  warn:   Resume but print a warning.
  remove: Remove all task directives.

[--omp-task-untied=abort|keep|no-warn]
  Special treatment for the untied task attribute. The default behavior
  is to remove the untied attribute, thus making all tasks tied, and
  print out a warning.
  abort:   Stop instrumentation with an error message when
           encountering a task directive with the untied attribute.
  keep:    Do not remove the untied attribute.
  no-warn: Do not print out a warning.
