                        OPARI2 2.0.4 OPEN ISSUES
                        ========================
                                                         Effective: October 2018

This file lists known limitations and unimplemented features of
the OPARI2 component.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Platform support

  - OPARI2 has been tested on the following platforms:
    + Cray XC systems
    + K Computer
    + various Linux/Intel (x86/x64/Power8/ARM AArch32/AArch64) clusters
    The provided configure options (see INSTALL) may provide a good
    basis for building and testing the toolset on other systems.

  - The following platforms have not been tested recently:
    + IBM Blue Gene/Q
    + IBM Blue Gene/P
    + Cray XT, XE, XK
    + Sun Solaris/SPARC-based clusters
    However the supplied buildsystem might still work on these
    systems.

  - The following platforms have not been tested:
    + NEC SX-9
    + IBM Blue Gene/L
    + SiCortex systems
    + other NEC SX systems

  Known issues
  ------------

  - All languages

      + OPARI2, per default, processes source files before the
        compiler preprocessor, so macros and included files are not
        processed. Conditionally compiled source code is also not
        resolved and can therefore result in erroneous instrumentation
        of partial OpenMP directives. These limitation can be resolved
        by passing preprocessed code to OPARI2 using the
        --preprocessed flag.

      + The instrumented source files generated by OPARI2 may confuse
        automatic dependency tracking by "make", "autotools", etc.
        For autotools, configure with "--disable-dependency-tracking".

      + Literal file-filter rules like "INCLUDE bt.f" for files that
        will be processed by OPARI2 do not work, as OPARI2 changes the
        file name (e.g., to bt.opari.f).

      + Some OpenMP compilers (e.g. PGI) are non-standard-conforming
        in the way they process OpenMP directives by not allowing
        macro replacement of OpenMP directive parameters. This results
        in error messages containing references to POMP_DLIST_#####
        where ##### is a five-digit number. In this case, try to use
        the OPARI2 option "--nodecl". This is unfortunately not a
        perfect workaround, as this can trigger other errors in some
        rare cases.

      + When compiling with the PGI compiler version 10.1, local
        variables that are defined after an OpenMP for directive share
        the same memory address. This breaks the OPARI2
        instrumentation for task tracking. Our recommendation is to
        use a newer compiler version, According to our tests, later
        compiler versions have fixed this issues. We tested with PGI
        compiler version 11.7.

      + Sometimes instrumentation of OpenMP source files work, but the
        traces get enormously large because the application is using
        large numbers (millions) of small OpenMP synchronization
        operations like atomic, locks or flushes which are
        instrumented by default. Also, in that case, the
        instrumentation overhead might become excessive.

        In that case, you can tell OPARI2 not to instrument these
        directives by using the
        "--disable=omp[:directive|group[:inner],...]" option. Valid
        values for directive are:

          atomic, critical, flush, locks, master, ordered, single

        or "sync" which disables all of the above.

        Of course, then these directives are not measured and you
        should keep this in mind, when you analyze the results.
        Although they do not show up in the analysis report that the
        application might still have some performance problem
        because. This may especially be the case, because of too many
        OpenMP synchronization calls!

      + Instrumented Intel Xeon-Phi offload regions cause compile
        errors. You need to manually guard the instrumented POMP2
        calls by "#ifndef __INTEL_OFFLOAD" preprocessor statements to
        prevent them from being compiled. The next OPARI2 release will
        automate this process.

      + Object files created by the Intel compiler with interprocedural
        optimization (-ipo) cannot be analyzed by nm for startup
        initialization of the OpenMP region handles. Workaround is to
        use only -ip during compilation or to use runtime initialization
        of the OpenMP region handles inside of the analysis tool.

      + The option --omp-tpd cannot be used on Fujitsu systems (K,
        FX10, FX100).

      + Parentheses used in chunksize calculations within a schedule
        clause, e.g., schedule(dynamic, (a)*(b)), will cause a
        compilation error. As a workaround, you can calculate the
        chuncksize into a temporary variable prior to its usage in the
        schedule clause.

  - Fortran:

      + The !$OMP END DO and !$OMP END PARALLEL DO directives are required
        (and are not optional as described in the OpenMP specification) for
        F77 style do loops which end with a lable and continue statement.

      + The atomic expression controlled by a !$OMP ATOMIC directive has
        to be on a line all by itself in fixed form source files.

      + The !$OMP END ATOMIC directive must not be used if it is
        optional. This directive is optional except if the capture
        clause is used. In this case the instrumentation of atomic
        directives needs to be disabled via by passing
        --disable=omp:atomic to opari2.

      + The Fortran95 statement terminator (";") is not handled correctly
        when it is used within parallel loops.

      + If an #ifdef block is used at the beginning of the variable
        definition part, instrumentation is incorrectly inserted within
        the block and not compiled later when the evaluation is false.

      + Some Fortran compilers (e.g., Sun) don't fully support C
        preprocessor commands, especially the "#line" commands. In
        case you track a compilation error on a OPARI2
        modified/instrumented file down to such a statement, try using
        "--nosrc" as this suppresses the generation of "#line"
        statements. (With the Sun Fortran compiler, using "-xpp=cpp"
        is a better workaround.)

      + The first SECTION directive inside a SECTIONS workshare directive
        is required (and is not optional as described in the OpenMP
        specification).

      + Fortran .f files are identified as Fortran77 files even if
        they contain Fortran90 code. You need to manually add the
        --f90 option to process these files successfully if renaming is
        not an option.

      + If you use a fixed form Fortran and override the fixed form
        requirement by a compiler switch you might need to add
        --free-form to the OPARI2 commandline to get a compilable
        instrumentation. Use --fix-form analogously.

      + OPARI2 requires that the program is included in a PROGRAM block.
        Using the compilation unit as implicit PROGRAM block will result
        in erroneous code.

      + Compiler specific directives starting with "!DIR$" need to be
        followed by a whitespace character before the directive keyword.

      + The clauses 'num_threads' and 'if' to the parallel directive
        must not reside as a sole clause on a line.

      + OpenMP directives that span over several lines must not
        contain preprocessor directives. This is a regression from
        OPARI2 version 1.1.4.

      + The default(none) clause to the parallel directive must not be
        used in a continuation line but on the same line as the
        parallel directive.

      + Strings within a pair of parenthesis, e.g., (..., msg="my msg"),
        must either appear on a single line or the closing parenthesis
        needs to appear on a line following the end quotation mark of
        the string. Otherwise, include statements might appear not at
        the correct place.

  - C/C++:

      + Structured blocks describing the extent of an OpenMP pragma
        need to be either compound statements {....}, while loops, or
        simple statements. In addition, for loops are supported after
        <omp for> and <omp parallel for pragmas>. Complex statements
        like if-then-else or do-while need to be enclosed in a block (
        {....} ).

      + C99 6.10.9 _Pragma operators are not supported.

      + Codes relying on the definition of macros to select specific
        features from system header files, e.g., __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS
        or _GNU_SOURCE, need to define these macros on the compiler
        command line rather than in header or source files.

  It is planned to address these limitations in future releases.
